        <p>
          We run a tight, joyful 7‑day sprint that blends design and engineering from day one. No telephone game, no
          layers — just the people doing the work, doing it with you. That means faster decisions, fewer meetings, and a
          launch that actually happens this week.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also put outcomes over artifacts. Your story gets sharpened, your message gets simpler, and every section
          earns its spot. The result isn’t just a shiny site — it’s a website that moves people to act.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we keep budgets friendly without cutting craft. A compact senior team, a clear scope, and modern
          tooling give you brand‑level polish at startup speed. You own everything on day one, plus a tidy edit guide so
          your team can keep shipping without us.
